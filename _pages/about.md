Welcome to my website!

**Background:**  
I'm a Research Scientist at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/applied-sciences/people/adrian-bazaga), pioneering the development of cutting-edge foundational Small Language Models (SLMs) that deliver powerful, agentic AI experiences directly on user devices. I focus on pushing the boundaries of what's possible with on-device intelligence, enabling richer, seamless, and highly interactive experiences for millions of users globally. Notably, my work has been integrated into the Microsoft Windows ecosystem, powering [the next-generation user experiences](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/05/06/introducing-a-new-generation-of-windows-experiences/) at unprecedented scale.

I hold a Ph.D. in Machine Learning from the University of Cambridge, where I conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and [Prof. Gos Micklem](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/gm263). My research has been published in leading Machine Learning conferences such as ICLR, ICML, ACL and EMNLP, as well as in Nature journals. Previously, I gained research experience through internships at Microsoft Research and Amazon AGI, where I explored novel training schemes to enhance few-step generation in diffusion models, and test-time scaling for temporal reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). Prior to that, I spent ~5 years in various startups, working at the intersection of AI and biology.

**Research Interests:**  
My [research](../research/) is centered around advancing the capabilities of AI, particularly in the areas of foundational LLMs and multimodality. I enjoy developing innovative architectures that enhance the applicability of generative models, and can seamlessly integrate diverse data modalities to address both fundamental challenges and real-world problems üß™. My current focus is on building foundational language models with agentic capabilities, expanding their multimodal capabilities, refining new training methodologies, improving inference efficiency, and ensuring robustness and alignment. I'm passionate about using AI to drive impactful projects at a global scale and am always open to collaborations that push the boundaries of what AI can achieve üëê.

**Beyond Research:**  
In addition to my core research, I'm interested in how advancements in generative models can revolutionize education and governance. I'm deeply committed to conducting research with a significant impact and am eager to engage in discussions and collaborations that align with these goals.
