Welcome to my website!

I am a final-year PhD student at University of Cambridge, working on **-** and supervised by [Prof. Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and [Prof. Gos Micklem](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/gm263). Before this, I obtained my Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science and Master‚Äôs in Machine Learning degrees from University of La Laguna and Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) in 2017 and 2019.

My [research](../research/) focuses on devising architectures for NLP systems, with emphasis on multi-modality and Large Language Models for solving both fundamental and real-world problems. For my engineering work, I'm dedicated to designing software systems for streamlining research, optimizing and scaling ML pipelines. I'm proficient in translating user requirements to software, and my diverse experience enables me to thrive in cross-disciplinary environments. I am dedicated to conducting high-impact research and open for collaborations üëê. 

Tangentially, I've been exploring how advancements in natural language processing, specifically generative models, can enhance and support modern education systems and government. If you are interested in discussing about this, please contact me.

In my free time, you can catch me training in the gym, enjoying nature, or tasting new dishes.
