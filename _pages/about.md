Welcome to my website!

**Research Interests:**  
My [research](../research/) is centered around advancing the capabilities of AI, particularly in the realms of multimodality and large language models. I aim to develop innovative architectures that can seamlessly integrate diverse data modalities to address both fundamental challenges and real-world problems üß™. My current focus is on enhancing generative models, expanding their multimodal capabilities, refining new training methodologies, improving inference efficiency, and ensuring robustness and alignment. I am passionate about using AI to contribute to scientific discovery and am always open to collaborations that push the boundaries of what AI can achieve üëê.

**Background:**  
I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of [Prof. Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and [Prof. Gos Micklem](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/gm263). My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, followed by a Master's in Machine Learning. I have honed my research skills through internships at leading organizations like Microsoft Research and Amazon Science, where I worked in areas such as reasoning with Large Language Models and novel training schemes to improve few-step generation for diffusion models. Previously, I spent ‚àº5 years in various start-ups, working at the intersection of AI and medicine.

**Beyond Research:**  
In addition to my core research, I am exploring how advancements in natural language processing, particularly generative models, can revolutionize education and governance. I am deeply committed to conducting research with a significant impact and am eager to engage in discussions and collaborations that align with these goals.
