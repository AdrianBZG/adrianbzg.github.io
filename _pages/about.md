I am a final-year PhD student at Imperial College London, working on **Graph Neural Networks** and supervised by [Prof. Michael Bronstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bronstein). Until November 2022, I also worked as a Machine Learning Researcher at Twitter. Prior to that, I was at Fabula AI, a startup developing a deep learning technology to detect fake news, which was then [acquired by Twitter](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/twitter-bags-deep-learning-talent-behind-london-startup-fabula-ai/) in June 2019. Previously, I completed an MPhil at the University of Cambridge and a BEng at Imperial College London, both in Computer Science. 

My [research](../research/) focuses on bridging the gap between academic research and real-world applications of Graph Neural Networks. My co-authors I have developed methods for scaling Graph Neural Networks to **large graphs**, learning on **temporal graphs**, and dealing with **missing node features**. I prefer solutions that are simple to understand and implement, and are highly scalable. For example, see our [**SIGN** model](https://towardsdatascience.com/simple-scalable-graph-neural-networks-7eb04f366d07) which is currently **used in production at [Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/graph-machine-learning-at-airbnb-f868d65f36ee)** to improve their trust & safety service predictions, or our [**TGN** Model](https://towardsdatascience.com/temporal-graph-networks-ab8f327f2efe) which has more than [**750 Github stars**](https://github.com/twitter-research/tgn). During my time at Twitter, I additionally worked on applied product problems such as the **who-to-follow** recommendation feature, for which I developed an embedding-based solution resulting in an increase of over **1.2M follow actions daily**. 

Away from machine learning, I recharge my batteries hiking, scuba diving, or just being immersed in nature.
