Welcome to my website!

**Background:**  
I'm an AI Scientist at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/applied-sciences), where I work on empowering agentic AI experiences on [Copilot+ devices](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/05/20/introducing-copilot-pcs/) for millions of users worldwide, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs).

I hold a Ph.D. in Machine Learning from the University of Cambridge, where I conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) and [Prof. Gos Micklem](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/gm263). My research has been published in leading Machine Learning conferences such as ICLR, ICML, and EMNLP, as well as Nature journals. Previously, I gained research experience through internships at Microsoft Research and Amazon AGI, where I explored novel training schemes to enhance few-step generation in diffusion models, and test-time scaling for temporal reasoning with LLMs. Prior to that, I spent ~5 years in various startups, working at the intersection of AI and biology.

**Research Interests:**  
My [research](../research/) is centered around advancing the capabilities of AI, particularly in the areas of multimodality and LLMs. I enjoy developing innovative architectures that can seamlessly integrate diverse data modalities to address both fundamental challenges and real-world problems üß™. My current focus is on enhancing generative models, expanding their multimodal capabilities, refining new training methodologies, improving inference efficiency, and ensuring robustness and alignment. I'm passionate about using AI to drive impactful projects at a global scale and am always open to collaborations that push the boundaries of what AI can achieve üëê.

**Beyond Research:**  
In addition to my core research, I'm interested in how advancements in natural language processing, particularly generative models, can revolutionize education and governance. I'm deeply committed to conducting research with a significant impact and am eager to engage in discussions and collaborations that align with these goals.
